# usage

receiver

```
Usage: ./receiver <pin> <interval in microsec> <duration in seconds> <output>
```

generate a file <output> of "signal pulses" history. The format of the file is
specified in `pulses.hh`.

replay

```
Usage: ./replay <pin> <file>
```

**receiver** and **replay** are meant to be used together to achieve the effect
of simulating control signal sent by your other devices.

# misc

- **test_matplotlib.cc**: experimental plotting

- **plot.py**: plot "signal pulse" history file. It show how to parse, but is not very easy to use.
